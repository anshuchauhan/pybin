A pastebin written for Google App Engine in python. A pastebin is a way to share code with others. Many lines of code in a chatroom or an email can disrupt the conversation and be difficult to view.

A pastebin can provide many of the benefits an editor can, such as line numbers, syntax highlighting and other features.

The mission of this project is to provide an easy way to share snippets of programming code.
